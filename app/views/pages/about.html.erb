<h1>About Colenda</h1>
<p>Colenda is a digital repository for digitized and born-digital material of enduring value to University and global scholarly communities, serving teaching and research needs. It provides direct access and long-term stewardship for these important resources.</p>
<p>Much of Colendaâ€™s content consists of materials owned and digitized by the Penn Libraries, including significant collections that have been donated to the library. Colenda also includes some public-domain digital objects that were created from assets owned by other institutions in the course of a joint project with the Penn Libraries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/collections/digital-projects">Descriptions of the collections</a> and <a href="http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/gallery/">exhibits presenting them</a> can be found on the main library website. Not all objects are members of a collection.</p>

<h2>Software components</h2>
<p>Colenda is repository software designed for long-term preservation of digital assets and metadata.  It is Open Source, built on the <a href="http://samvera.org/">Samvera framework</a>, utilizing <a href="https://github.com/samvera/hydra-works">Hydra::Works</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm/wiki">Portland Common Data Model</a> for describing and structuring objects.  Additional functionality is provided through a customized application written in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>.  The application uses the storage platform <a href="http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/start/intro/">Ceph</a> for asset storage, selected for high availability, high replication, performance, and fault-tolerance.  Colenda also uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> and <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> to track changes to objects over time.  More information about each of these components can be found in the links below.</p><p>Colenda also complies with <a href="https://iiif.io/about/">International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) standards</a>, which ensures high-quality images, interoperability with other image viewers, and the ability to download digital materials.</a></p>
